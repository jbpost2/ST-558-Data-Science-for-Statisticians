This video describes how the course runs and how to navigate the course websites! 

In this course we use the 'Panopto player' for our videos. When popped out into a new window, this is a great player for videos as you can search through the captions, focus on a given screen, etc. I highly recommend watching the video below using this 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.
