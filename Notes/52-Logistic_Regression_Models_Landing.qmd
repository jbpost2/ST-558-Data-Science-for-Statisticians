The video below introduces the logistic regression model. This model is very useful for modeling binary responses (there are extensions to response variables with more than two values).

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.

## Notes

**Note: The code on slide 29 of the video differs slightly from the code in the notes below. An older version of the `tidymodels` package was used in the video and that code no longer works. The code in the slides attached is the way to do this now.**
