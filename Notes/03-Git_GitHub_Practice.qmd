## Getting Comfortable with `GitHub`

Hopefully you now have some idea about the purpose of `Git`/`GitHub`. `GitHub` is an online hosting service for `Git` repositories. If you've never used `Git` and `GitHub` before it is really quite intimidating. We'll start small and build as we go through the semester! Now let's do some practice.

- First, go to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com</a> and signup for a `GitHub` account (if you haven't already).

- Once you have an account, <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read this introduction to `GitHub`</a> (we'll look at using `Git` and the command line shortly - for now we'll stick to the web editor).

    + Follow the steps in the article to create your first repository and do some `Git` actions!

Once you've completed the above part. You should download `Git` to your computer.

- See the <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installing `Git` page</a> or the corresponding chapter from <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/install-git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">*happy git with R*</a> (this one includes some troubleshooting as well).

- For Windows, there aren't many things to select as you install but go ahead and <strong>include the bash terminal</strong> if that's an option.

Now read through the <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce yourself to `Git`</a> chapter of *happygitwithr*.

- For those that want to use the shell/terminal: Mac has a native shell/terminal/command line interpreter (usually called *terminal* in your launchpad area).  For Windows folks, after you've installed `Git` you'll have access to the `Git Bash` terminal.  Access this by clicking on the start menu and typing in bash. You can also use the command prompt in Windows (`cmd` in the start menu). I'll use a bit of both the bash terminal and the Windows command prompt. Commands differ but the functionality is very similar.

Great, now try to work through <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapters 9, 11, and 12</a> of *happygitwithr*.

- If you get stuck here, that's ok. Just move on! This part isn't really required right now but should be figured out soon so that you can start working seamlessly!
- If stuck, there is a bit more material about `Git`/`GitHub`/`RStudio` this week. Check that out and then maybe come back here.
- Set up a meeting with me if you can't figure this part out soon!
