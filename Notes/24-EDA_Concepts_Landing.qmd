The video below discusses concepts around exploratory data analysis (EDA). This is a vital step that you'll do almost anytime you have data! It is a bit of an art form and takes some subject matter expertise to do really well but we'll talk about the most common steps.

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.
