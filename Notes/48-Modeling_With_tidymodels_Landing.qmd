The video below discusses the `tidymodel` package and its approach to modeling. This package is a replacement for the `caret` package that has been widely used previously. 

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.

## Notes

**Note: The code on slides 15 & 16 of the video differs slightly from the code in the notes below. An older version of the `tidymodels` package was used in the video and that code no longer works. The code in the slides attached is the way to do this now.**
