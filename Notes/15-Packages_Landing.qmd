The video below formally discusses `R` packages. Packages are collections of code (or data, etc.) around some topic. Packages (also called modules in other languages) extend what you can do with `R`. 

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.
