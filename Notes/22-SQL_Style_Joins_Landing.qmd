The video below discusses SQL style joins. Recall that when we have a database we often have multiple tables (or data frames) that are linked by some column or columns. When that is the case, we may want to combine the tables into one. That is the idea of a join!

I highly recommend watching the video using the 'full' Panopto player. There is a 'pop out' button in the bottom right of the video to enter this viewer.
